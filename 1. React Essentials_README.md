# ðŸ“˜ **"Section 3: React Essentials" â€” Interview-Focused Revision Notes**


#### ðŸ”¹ "What is React?"

> "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focused on creating fast, interactive UIs with a component-based architecture."

* Developed and maintained by **Meta (Facebook)**
* React apps are **declarative** and **component-driven**
* Emphasizes **reusability**, **unidirectional data flow**, and **virtual DOM** for performance

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "React Components"

> "A component in React is a reusable, isolated piece of UI logic defined as a JavaScript function or class."

* **Functional components** (recommended)
* **Class components** (legacy, still used in some codebases)
* Components must return **JSX**

**Interview Tip**: You may be asked to build or explain a component with props/state.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "JSX â€“ JavaScript XML"

> "JSX is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript."

* Transpiled to `React.createElement(...)`
* Must return **one root element** (use fragments if needed)
* Supports **JavaScript expressions** inside `{}`

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "Props (Properties)"

> "Props are inputs passed into components to configure them."

* Read-only (immutable)
* Used to pass data from **parent to child**
* Destructuring makes props usage cleaner

**Example**:

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "State and useState() Hook"

> "State is data maintained inside a component that can change over time and trigger re-renders."

* `useState(initialValue)` returns `[state, setState]`
* State updates are **asynchronous**
* Avoid directly modifying state

**Interview Tip**: Be able to explain how React detects changes (via shallow comparison) and re-renders.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "Handling Events"

> "React uses camelCase event handlers and passes synthetic events."

* Example: `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`
* Event handlers are just functions

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "Re-rendering & Virtual DOM"

> "React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering by comparing it with the previous version and updating only changed parts."

* Improves performance by minimizing actual DOM operations
* Component **re-renders** when **state or props change**

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "Component Communication"

> "Parent-to-child uses props; child-to-parent uses callback functions passed as props."

**Example**: Passing `onClick` from parent to child

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "Dynamic Content in JSX"

> "Use curly braces `{}` to inject variables, expressions, or function calls inside JSX."

```jsx
<p>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome!" : "Please log in"}</p>
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "Lists and Keys"

> "Use `.map()` to render lists; always provide a unique `key` prop."

```jsx
{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ "Conditional Rendering"

> "Render elements based on conditions using `if`, ternary (`? :`), or `&&`."

```jsx
{isLoggedIn && <Profile />}
```

---
