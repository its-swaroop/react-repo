# **" React Essentials – Deep Dive" — Interview-Optimized Revision Notes**


#### 🔹 "React’s Component Rendering Flow"

> "React re-renders components when state or props change, using a reconciliation process with the virtual DOM."

* **Every state/prop update = new render**
* Only **affected components** re-render
* React uses a **diffing algorithm** to update only changed DOM nodes

---

#### 🔹 "The Importance of Component Functions Re-running"

> "In React, functional components are re-invoked (re-run) on every render."

* This is **expected behavior**
* Local variables are re-created
* Only `useState` and `useEffect` retain data between renders

---

#### 🔹 "Rules of Hooks"

> "Hooks must be called unconditionally at the top level of a component or custom Hook."

✅ Always:

* Inside a **React function component**
* In the **same order** on every render

❌ Never:

* Inside `if`, `for`, `while`, or any nested function

---

#### 🔹 "Re-Rendering and Performance Pitfalls"

> "Unnecessary re-renders can slow apps; optimize using memoization and key design decisions."

* **Avoid inline functions/objects** in JSX when possible
* Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to optimize

---

#### 🔹 "React Fragments"

> "Fragments let you return multiple elements without extra DOM nodes."

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </>
);
```

* Avoids extra `<div>` wrappers
* Clean markup, helpful for CSS and accessibility

---

#### 🔹 "Portals"

> "Portals allow rendering children into a DOM node outside the root DOM hierarchy."

* Use for **modals**, **tooltips**, **overlays**
* Created with:

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)
```

---

#### 🔹 "Refs and the useRef Hook"

> "Refs provide a way to directly access DOM elements or persist values without triggering re-renders."

* Common use cases:

  * Accessing input fields (`ref.current.value`)
  * Storing timeouts or previous values

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />
```

---

#### 🔹 "Managing Side Effects with useEffect"

> "The `useEffect` hook handles side effects like fetching data, setting subscriptions, and updating the DOM."

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // side-effect logic
  return () => {
    // cleanup logic
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

* Runs **after** render
* Optional cleanup with return function
* **Dependency array** controls execution

**Interview Tip**: Be ready to explain how and when `useEffect` runs, and how to avoid infinite loops.
